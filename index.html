        <h1>Subject DM1-6</h1>
        <h3>Novel Terrarian Specimen #5 - The Slayer</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Subject DM1-6, dubbed <i><b>The Slayer</b></i> is a novel Terrarian lifeform, originating
        <mark><i>beyond the confines of the Terrariums</i></mark>, suggesting that the subject somehow 
        <mark><i>broke into</i></mark> the realm of the Terrariums in order to achieve a <b>personal goal</b>
        of some sort. The lifeform has been deduced to be a <b>male lifeform</b>, with black hair and
        pale skin. Apart from the typical <i>seemingly omnipotent strength</i> of the Terrarium lifeforms, 
        The Slayer seems to find joy in the indiscriminate destruction of all things related to the 
        <mark><b><i>World Evils</i></b></mark> and the underworld.</p>
